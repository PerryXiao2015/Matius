# Matius' PhD Project
This project is to use Arduin and a relay to control the electromagnetic brake.
<li>ble_sense_33_test.ino is the Arduio code to run on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev 2 board that controls the relay.</li>
<li>App.py is the Python code to run on a laptop with Bluethooth to control the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 board.</li>
